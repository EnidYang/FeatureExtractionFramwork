# FeatureExtractionFramwork
A framework to ease feature extraction and management

Why do I start this project: in real application, machine learning model is often trained with a set of selected features and used for real-time prediction. So an efficient and extendible feature extraction module is necessary. 

Features:
* c++ based
* extendible
* support both binary and real-valued features
* can be used for both training and prediction (offline and online)
